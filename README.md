# OpenServerGuard
OpenServerGuard (OSG) is a free &amp; opensource system which can monitor or take any data as input and take action based on user-defined conditions/rules. OpenServerGuard helps you monitor, act &amp; protect. 

Its powerful automation features are not just limited to servers or machines, any flow can be automated using openServerGuard as any form input can be "a sensor" and any action you may wish to do is possible, either you write it yourself or take pre-made module, made available officially or from the community.
